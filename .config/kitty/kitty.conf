#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 2000

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores one character in 4 bytes, so approximatively
#: 2500 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line. A value of zero or
#: less disables this feature. The maximum allowed size is 4GB.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.

touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by a touchpad. Note this is only used
#: for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
#: Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction.

copy_on_select no

#: Copy to clipboard on select. With this enabled, simply selecting
#: text with the mouse will cause the text to be copied to clipboard.
#: Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not have the concept of
#: primary selections. Note that this is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the clipboard.

rectangle_select_modifiers ctrl+alt

#: The modifiers to use rectangular selection (i.e. to select text in
#: a rectangular block with the mouse)

select_by_word_characters :@-./_~? &

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alpha-numeric character in the unicode database will be matched.

# TODO(#9): update mac-specific kitty configuration
macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, a value of
#: background means to use the background color of the currently
#: active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
#: #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack, as
#: there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color
#: of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it
#: is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both,
#: you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
#: hide_window_decorations.

macos_option_as_alt yes

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique.

macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (Option+Tab) on macOS.

macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes. For example, a value of
#: 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel
#: antialiasing at common font sizes.

macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but
#: less pretty.

macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Enable/disable custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see
#: on both light and dark backgrounds. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines.
